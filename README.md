# TicketPros.io

## Overview

TicketPros.io is a specialized platform designed to streamline the process of handling debris load tickets. Built with Django, the application allows users to upload their debris tickets, and then leverages Tesseract OCR and PyTesseract to extract all relevant information from the tickets automatically. The application also includes features to identify errors in the OCR accuracy and generates pay reports based on user input information for each contractor/subcontractor. This repository serves as a showcase of the project and is not open for contributions as it is a private repository.
